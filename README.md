## Overview
**In this repository i have uploaded both [classification](https://github.com/MayukhBaruaha/Support-Vactor-Machine/blob/main/support%20vector%20classifier/implementation_%26_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb) and [regression](https://github.com/MayukhBaruaha/Support-Vactor-Machine/blob/main/support%20vector%20Regressor/SVR_implimentation.ipynb) problams using support vactor machines,<br>
along with the implimentation of different types of [kernels](https://github.com/MayukhBaruaha/Support-Vactor-Machine/blob/main/Kernels%20implimatation/SVC_Kernels.ipynb) using mathematics(without using standered libraries like sklearn).**
